# Helper Scripts
This repository contains a few Python scripts that were used to calculate some code-/repository-metrics.
Where appropriate, a defined time range was used to collect the metrics. 
The time range spanned roughly 6 months, starting December 12th, 2022 and ending June 5th, 2023.
Note that the `quantiles.py` script only contains a few example values as an input. 
If you would like to check the results presented in the paper, simply replace the list of values with the ones required for the actual use case.

## Prerequisites
In order to use the scripts the following prerequisites are required:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.10+
- [Pydriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 2.5.1
- [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) 2.1.1
